techDescription: 'This project was a complete redesign of their existing site. I used Next.js to create a fast, server-rendered site that feeds from a DotNET API and React admin dashboard. <br /><br />Since their menu is well established and nice to look at, I created a products gallery to showcase all product items which opens in a custom, SEO friendly modal.'

designDescription: 'Given the history of the company, I wanted to keep the design simple and clean. I used a lot of white space and their existing brand color scheme to keep the focus on the food and the history of the company. I also integrated their Instagram feed to keep the site fresh and up to date.'
