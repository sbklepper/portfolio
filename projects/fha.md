techDescription: 'FHA loan program was a legacy project that needed a complete overhaul from PHP & jQuery to NextJS. One of the main features was the FHA loan calculators. I created custom calculators that would allow the user to input their loan amount, interest rate, and loan term to calculate their monthly payment.'

designDescription: 'Another main feature was the articles section. I created a custom admin dashboard that would allow the client to add, edit, and delete articles. The articles would then be displayed on the front end in a custom designed blog.'
