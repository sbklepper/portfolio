techDescription: 'Being that this project was mostly information based, I reached for NextJS to serve static pages and perform fast. There also was a program/data heavy demand that was ever changing, so I utilized a GraphQL infrastructure with GraphCMS. I reached for Markdown to quickly edit/change content as need be, and am serving it via MDXRemote.'

designDescription: 'The design was kept minimal and simple only accentuating key features. Since there needs to be contact with Brokers & Agents about programs they are interested in, the contact forms are pre-populated with the program the user is on. I also created custom PDF flyers with infographics containing company related information. There is both a light & dark version available.'
