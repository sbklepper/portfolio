techTabImgAlt: "Winfield's Product Slider"
techDescription: "Since the client wanted a way to showcase their products, but stay within their initial theme of a Wes Anderson feel--I utilized a React Slider library called 'Swiper', but customized it to fit their theme with curtains and hands that slide the products. <br /><br />There also is a custom admin dashboard that allows the client to add, edit, and delete products from the slider and products page."

designTabImgAlt: 'Ultra Demolition custom image gallery & slideshow'
designDescription: 'The design of the application was primarily based around their ever changing product line. I wanted to make sure that the products were the main focus of the site, so I created a custom image gallery and product modal to not only showcase their products, but also link to 3rd party companies to make ordering a breeze.'
