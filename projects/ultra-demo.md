techDescription: 'One of the requirements was a functioning review system. I utilized MongoDB Atlas as a cloud provider to help create a 5 star rating system with an average score rating functionality. Since the site was primarily a brochure site, I reached for NextJS to serve pre-built static pages making it noticeably fast.'

designDescription: 'They already had an existing logo and color theme, but they needed a way to display their massive collection of 66+ images. I created a custom gallery with a lightbox/slideshow functionality to display thier work. Since they have a strong social media presence, I integrated their FaceBook feed and created a custom social widget for desktop & mobile.'

**Ultra Demolition** is a local demolition company that serves south-east Texas. They approached me with a list of guidelines and necessities for their website, along with a timeline. They have a strong social media presence so there were quite a few unique features I had to implement.
